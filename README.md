# pomogarden

Welcome to pomogarden!

These days, work and school related stress seem to be at an all time high, especially in students. This project means to target the rising problem of stress and mental-fatigue by providing students with:
1. A relaxing and rewarding way to structure their studies.
1. Tips and tricks that promote well-being and good study habits, generated by AI.

We used Cohere API as our large language model in this program to generate unique dialogue. Our webapp was made using Flask.

This webapp implements a pomodoro timer. If you haven’t heard of the pomodoro technique, briefly, it’s a scientifically researched way of structuring your working time - a 25 minute work period, then a five minute break. It has been proven to be a great method to keep students on track, especially those who lose their attention span quickly.
Our webapp is also interactive! The garden grows with you as you study, and each plant has its own unique personality you can explore.
